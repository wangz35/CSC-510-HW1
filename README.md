This repository contains the codework of the project VowelCheck. The aim of this project is to provide a function to determine whether a given character input is a consonant of a vowel. This code provides correct outputs whether the character is given in upper or lower case.
The designated input value for this code should be a single character and the output will be printed out, and if the input is a vowel will be returned 1, 
While using this code, please keep in mind that this code was built for vowels in Latin alphabet (a, e, i, o, u) and does not currently handle other cases.
